Research Experience 
07/2011 – 10/2011	Visiting student, Rice University
- Project Description: Using MapReduce and HBase cluster to execute ZPL program. ZPL is an array language for scientific computation on parallel machines.
- Current Status: Under implementation according to our initial design

07/2010 – 07/2011   Distributed NoSQL storage performance
-  Project Description: We evaluated HBase with some real applications, and then studied the HBase implementation to seek for optimization or better design.
-  Current Status: HBase falsely sequetializes irrelative put operations and thus causes long lock acquiring time. We’re attempting to parallelize these operations.

03/2008 – 08/2011   MapReduce performance on cluster with multi-core nodes (Cooperated project with Intel)
-  Project Description: We studied the MapReduce performance on multi-core cluster. We tried to exploit the power of multi-core machines to maximize MapReduce efficiency.
-  Results: The poor performance of Hadoop mainly comes from object creation, large memory footprint, naive data structure and lack of good multithreading support. We have implemented a prototype system Azwraith, which outperforms the original MapReduce implementation from 1.4X to 3.5X.
-  Current Status: Identify the interrupt handling issues in Hadoop. Propose a federated schedule model for MapReduce.

09/2009 – 11/2009  Worked on understanding the characteristics of IO in Hadoop and surveyed applying SSD to Hadoop and HBase
-  Results: Mixed workloads incur a random disk access pattern in Hadoop. Using SSD as a disk cache and intermediate storage would gain a good speedup.

03/2009 – 04/2009  Evaluated parallel shared-memory applications with MapReduce cluster
-  Results: Frequent communications in this kind of applications cause significant overhead on cluster. We proposed some extensions to the MapReduce model in our APPT’09 paper.

03/2008   Joined the system group at Parallel Processing Institute (PPI)
